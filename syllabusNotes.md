# Syllabus Notes

## General Information
**time:** 3 - 4:20pm Tuesday Thursday.

## Course Description
**This course will require completion of 100 hours in a field placement.**

## Capstone project
> A content creation app will allow content creators to put content directoy into the database that feeds content to the Listening Here app. This is important because non-technical content creators can't be expected to do things like memorize and use foreign keys to input data that spans multiple fields of the database. They need a user-friendly system.

>An acoustic ecology app that has grown out of this project. This app will encourage people to engage with environmental sounds in a different way from listening here and will collect sonic data into our database.

## Grading
> if a student does high quality work and 100 hours, they get a perfect score. If a student claims they did 100 hours but they do substantially less work or extremely low quality work, that is reflected in their grade.

>The quantity grade us based on hours reported.

>The quality grade is based on:
Ice Breaker Module 5%<br>
Documentation & State of repository for future students 15%<br>
Participation 10%<br>
Meeting Minutes 10%<br>
Set Weekly goals 10%<br>
Consistent Progress towards goals 10%<br>
Other work on project 30%<br>
Final Presentation (Showcase) 10%<br>

## Documentation & State of Repository
>If someone is given the task of documentation for users, they would need to document what they've documented, how, and why, so someone else can take over the job from them.

## Participation
>Zoom, breakout room.<br>
Peropdic meeting with the instructor<br>
Slack


## Minutes
Facilitator: this person decides what needs to happen in the meeting, sets a schedule (which they share with the timekeeper), and makes sure everyone gets a chance to speak.<br>

Timekeeper: this person makes sure the schedule is maintained. They give occasional warnings of how much time is left so people can decide to move it along.<br>

Note Taker: this person takes notes on the gist of what each person says. This isn't verbatim; it's a summary that hits the high points.<br>

## Weekly Goals
Each week, as part of your group meeting, you are expected to come up with tasks for the next week. Each person in the team must have a plan for the next week's work recorded in the meeting minutes. 

## Presentation (Showcase)
The showcase will almost certainly be a week or two before the end of the semester. Your presentation can be done as an individual, with a subset of your team, or with your entire team, depending on what makes sense for the work you've been doing. If it is done as a team, everyone will need to contribute to the presentation. If your team is large, it would be wise to analyze your project and decide if there are different approaches to the presentation that different members or sub-teams could make so that everyone can put their best foot forward and get the best possible grade. The grade will reflect both the presentation itself (shared grade, if applicable) and how each individual's work/insight/progress is reflected in the presentation (individual grade).

## Documentation & State of Repository
**We will not be using Blackboard.<br>
Do NOT hand in work through email.**

## Required & Recommended Materials
VS Code or ATOM

We will use https://draw.io for diagramming. It is free and will let us save versions to the repository instead of working only in the cloud, for most of our diagramming.

Windows Users: git bash or a gui git client.

We will use github to submit most coursework.

Students focusing on design will discuss software in an early meeting with the instructor. As a rule, everything must be saved in an open format but there might be exceptions based on what work needs to be done. In particular, if you choose to use adobe products, they have decided not to make their files openable by non-subscription versions of their software that only exceptionally wealthy people (probably none of us) can afford. If you have access to the expensive subscription version of software, anything you do must be saved to be backwards-compatible with an old verison (compatible with CS6 or earlier) or it must be saved in an open format such as pdf, svg, png, etc. instead of their proprietary formats.

## Attendance
As an online course, attendance is not directly graded. However, you are expected to keep up with the weekly work. All coursework except the Personal Project is due by the last day of class. There is no guarantee that work submitted after that deadline can be graded before grades are due.

## Communication
schedule a meeting via http://calendly.com/cmagnus

Come to a meeting scheduled by another student in the class. This is especially for organizing meetings with your team, but you can drop in on anyone's meeting and ask your question at the end if they don't use their full time. See the course slack for announced meeting times.

Message the instructor via the course slack. Unless it is private, you probably should post to a public channel instead of messaging. Posting questions and answers of general interest to the public slack channels counts as participation; contacting the instructor privately does not.

You may attempt email but do not expect a response unless the subject line consists of “inf 465 followed by a brief description of what you need to contact me about. I check my campus email sporadically (about once a week) but I get so much spam from the university that can’t be unsubscribed from.
