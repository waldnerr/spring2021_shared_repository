# Spring 2021 Shared Repository
---

## Branching

The entire class is sharing this repository. This is because you'll be working with shared repositories for the entire semester and it's good to get a sense of what that's like. Also, most repositories you work with out in the world will be shared.

The first thing you should do before working on this is make your own branch. Normally, you would name your branch based on the project you're working on. For instance, if you were responsible for the css stylesheet, you might make a branch named "style", because that's actually what you're doing. You should name your branch names things that are unique, related to your part of the project, and easy to type. Of course, everyone is doing the same project so we can't exactly do that this time. Just use your name as a branchname. If you aren't positive that you're the only person in the class with your name, you should use your full name and possibly initials. 

To be clear, this is the only repository where you should be using your name. For work in the project, you should give your branches descriptive names.

## Ice Breaker Notes

1. Please use this repository to **edit** existing files. Git tracks a file's history. If everyone starts with the same file, makes a branch, and edits it, it counts as the same file. If everyone makes files with identical names in their own branches, git will be confused by the different versioning history. We're going to practice both branching and merging with this exercise, so everyone's file must have the same history.

2. For each note-taking activity, be sure to make several commits. This will give you practice and help make sense of merging. 

3. Try to organize your notes along the lines of headings with bullets underneath. You can use the asterisk to represent bullets. Git merging, especially when people combine different material into the same file (which is very common when coding) works better when it's organized the same way and has many lines. Merging is less fun with paragraphs. If you preserve the structure of the document you're reading, (i.e. keep the section names then put your notes in bullets underneath), merging will be very straight forward.

## Merging Activity

1. On the day of the merging activity, one person on your team should create a branch for your team. Pick a descriptive name that goes with the project you're working on, not the kind of team name you might use for a TBL course where everyone is doing the same things. For instance, if we have a database team, their branch could be called *db* or *database*, but **not** something like *CaffeinatedCoders*. 

2. Merge your notes into the repository. Take turns. The first merge is trivial, that's why there are two note-taking activities. The person who does the first merge for the syllabus notes should **not** be the person who does the first merge on the Agile notes. This way, everyone will get a chance to see what it's like to use the mergetool to merge with code that is already there.

## Hours

1. You should checkout your own branch during the week to record your hours. 
2. Hours should be recorded in a spreadsheet that includes starting time, ending time, and does the math to calculate the total hours for the week. A sample spreadsheet can be found in this repository.
3. Winding down every work session should include committing what you've been working on, pushing that to the server, recording the end of your hours, committing your hours, then pushing to the server. If you're working effectively and the work you're doing meshes with the hours you claim, this won't be a big deal. But if you claim tons of hours and have nothing to show for it, this will be used to assess the validity of your hours. If you claim hours it looks like you didn't do, this is how you prove you did them; if you don't do this, we have to assume you're cheating and act accordingly. 
4. You should report your hours for the week to your team so they can record them in the minutes. Absent the need to double check your hours because hours claimed don't mesh with the work you've done and occasional random auditing to make sure reporting is accurate, this is where your hours will come from for your final grade. You needn't include the entire accounting, just say you worked 9 hours, or whatever, the previous week.

Disclaimer: You will use your team's branch to report your hours. This isn't private, but this class is trying to be internship-like and it's not private in a workplace if someone is out for a few days. If you can't put in all your hours, you needn't tell your team why; you should all be understanding if someone has serious life stuff interfere with their work. And no one needs anyone's personal details to not be mean about it. But at the same time, if someone is at risk to not get their hours in, the team might help them brainstorm ways of getting hours that will let someone succeed in the course if they're struggling. If it becomes a problem, you should involve the instructor.
