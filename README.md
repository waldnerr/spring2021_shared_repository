# Spring 2021 Shared Repository
---

## Branching

The entire class is sharing this repository. This is because you'll be working with shared repositories for the entire semester and it's good to get a sense of what that's like. Also, most repositories you work with out in the world will be shared.

The first thing you should do before working on this is make your own branch. Normally, you would name your branch based on the project you're working on. For instance, if you were responsible for the css stylesheet, you might make a branch named "style", because that's actually what you're doing. You should name your branch names things that are unique, related to your part of the project, and easy to type. Of course, everyone is doing the same project so we can't exactly do that this time. Just use your name as a branchname. If you aren't positive that you're the only person in the class with your name, you should use your full name and possibly initials. 

To be clear, this is the only repository where you should be using your name. For work in the project, you should give your branches descriptive names.

## Ice Breaker Notes

Please use this repository to **edit** existing files. Git tracks a file's history. If everyone starts with the same file, makes a branch, and edits it, it counts as the same file. If everyone makes files with identical names in their own branches, git will be confused by the different versioning history. We're going to practice both branching and merging with this exercise, so everyone's file must have the same history.
