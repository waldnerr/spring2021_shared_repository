# Agile Notes

## Scrum
**Scrum** is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

the Scrum is most frequently used by software development teams, its principles and lessons can be applied to all kinds of teamwork. This is one of the reasons Scrum is so popular. Often thought of as an agile project management framework, Scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.
## Sprints
**A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work.**
## Sprint planning
Sprint planning is an event in scrum that defines what can be delivered in the upcoming sprint and how that work will be achieved.

## backlog
A product backlog is a prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the roadmap and its requirements. The most important items are shown at the top of the product backlog so the team knows what to deliver first. The development team doesn't work through the backlog at the product owner's pace and the product owner isn't pushing work to the development team. Instead, the development team pulls work from the product backlog as there is capacity for it, either continually (kanban) or by iteration (scrum).  

## Agile Sprint Reviews
Step 1: define ‘done’
Step 2: celebrate the team
Step 3: reach across geographies
## Scrum roles and the truth about job titles in scrum
Learn why the three scrum roles(scrum master, product owner, and development team) describe key responsibilites not job titles.

## Scrum of Scrums
Scrum of Scrums is a scaled agile technique that offers a way to connect multiple teams who need to work together to deliver complex solutions.

It helps teams develop and deliver complex products through transparency, inspection, and adaptation, at scale. It’s particularly successful when all high-performing Scrum team members work towards a common goal, have trust, respect, and are completely aligned.
## Agile scrum artifacts
Agile scrum artifacts are information that a scrum team and stakeholders use to detail the product being developed, actions to produce it, and the actions performed during the project. The main agile scrum artifacts are product backlog, sprint backlog, and increments.

The term artifact is often associated with archaeological ruins and ancient relics. Yet in software development, the term artifact refers to key information needed during the development of a product. 

Agile has its own particular byproducts that emerge from the scrum experience of planning, development, tracking, and iteration of tasks to build software.
## Stand-ups for agile teams
Stand-ups are one of the fundamental parts of agile development, and it’s often the most misunderstood. Let’s be real: stand-ups by themselves don’t make your team agile. They aren’t about inflating egos or justifying job descriptions. They aren’t a time to plan; Sprint planning is for planning. They also aren’t the only time to mention blockers. If you’re stuck, ask for help!
